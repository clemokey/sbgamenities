Welcome to the "Salzburg Amenities Near Me" projectâ€”a comprehensive web application that helps users find essential amenities in Salzburg. In this post, I'll guide you through the steps taken to develop this application, from setting up the environment to adding advanced functionalities. "A wise man once said a good code should not have comments. If it is hard to write, it should also be hard to read" ... but I have made it easy for you and added comments in the codes. You're welcome. 

This is a basic HTML + CSS + Javascript application which uses Leaflet.js framework and Esri basemaps. It should not require any complex form of deployment. I have published a blog that can help you get this application up and running. It is available here[https://bamideleoke.dev/checkout/discovering-local-amenities-with-salzburg-amenities-near-me-application].

The application is live on [My Website](https://bamideleoke.dev/demo/sbgamenities/]) and [GH Pages](https://clemokey.github.io/sbgamenities/)
